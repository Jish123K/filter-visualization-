# filter-visualization

File.py=
This code defines a function visualize_filter that uses gradient ascent to generate visualizations of the filters in a specified layer of a pre-trained VGG-16 model. The function takes an input image, the index of the filter to be visualized, and the name of the layer containing the filter as inputs. The function then applies gradient ascent to maximize the activation of the specified filter, while also applying several regularization techniques to prevent the generated image from being too noisy or too high-frequency. Finally, the function returns the generated image.
